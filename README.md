# Scope To This plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
This plugin adds a scope to this functionality similar to its namesake in Visual Studio. Inspired by [this](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-scope-to-specific-folder-in-file-view/64525) feature request and the [File Explorer++](https://github.com/kelszo/obsidian-file-explorer-plus) plugin.
